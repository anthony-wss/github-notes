A lightweight Chrome extension that helps you track and manage notes for GitHub PRs, ensuring you never miss a potential contribution opportunity.

I am new to the open-source community, and I don't want to miss any potential issues or PRs where I can contribute.  
To solve this, I built **GitHub PR Notes Tracker**—a simple tool that lets me add and manage notes directly under GitHub PRs.

4. Click "Load Unpacked" and select the cloned repository.

5. Done! 🥳 Now, visit a GitHub PR page and start adding notes!
